\subsection{详细描述}
Handles memory access in a portable way. 

Provides simple, fast, and portable access to memory routines. These are only used to read data from buffers. That are L\+I\+T\+T\+LE E\+N\+D\+I\+AN due to the F\+AT specification.

These routines may need to be modified to your platform.
